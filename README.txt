### Workload
 I worked on, all of the Code taking may CSS elements from a third party Ninja Smoothie Git page. I also challenge myself and used a lot of his method for UI design,
 so many of my Pages were designed with .ejs files. A lot of the code was functioned off the Mongoose module and I tried my best to use it as best as I could. the overall design and feel is simple and easy to follow.
